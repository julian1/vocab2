OWL REASONERS
	- One basic function that a reasoner can perform is to check an OWL ontology for consistency

	- One basic function that a reasoner can perform is to check an OWL 
	ontology for consistency, i.e. whether it is possible for a class to have any 
	instances. It can also infer an ontology class hierarchy which may go beyond 
	the hierarchy asserted explicitly by OWL statements.

	- An ontology consists of a set of axioms which place constraints on sets 
	of individuals (called "classes") and the types of relationships permitted 
	between them. These axioms provide semantics by allowing systems to infer 
	additional information based on the data explicitly provided. A full 
	introduction to the expressive power of the OWL is provided in the W3C's OWL 
	Guide

OWL
	It's easier to understand what it is - by looking at the things it represents

		OWL in two ways: OWL DL and OWL Full

		classes
			owl:Class and individuals
			owl:DisjointClasses
			owl:equivalentClass
			owl:equivalentProperty
			owl:sameAs

		property characteristics
			owl:inverseOf
			owl:TransitiveProperty
			owl:FunctionalProperty


	As an RDF serialization, OWL is a more expressive extension of RDF 
	than of its precursor RDFS (section 4.4) or generic RDF (part 3). However, this 
	increased expressivity comes at the expense of increased complexity. 

	- Because of the complexity of OWL, OWL-based ontologies are nearly always constructed 
	using a software tool called an ontology editor.

	owl:DisjointClasses

	OWL allows any two classes to be declared disjoint, i.e. it is not allowable 
	for an individual to be an instance of both classes. Unless disjointness is 
	declared explicitly, it is allowable for an individual to be simultaneously a 
	member of any two (or more) classes. 

	- requires that objects that are literals rather than uri's are identified
	as such.

	- it's just a set of requirements that a vocab must follow.


OWL and RDFS
	Since OWL is an extension of RDFS, it contains some of the concepts introduced 
	to RDF by RDFS. OWL uses classes and properties, and includes terms from RDFS 
	and RDF including rdf:Property, rdfs:subClassOf, rdfs:subPropertyOf, 
	rdfs:range, and rdfs:domain which were discussed in section 4.3 and section 
	4.4. 

	The concept of a class in OWL is similar to its meaning in RDFS. In fact,

		owl:Class rdfs:subClassOf rdfs:Class


	Eg. An OWL:Class is a subClass of rdfs class !!!

ONTOLOY
	- in general an ontology describes the formal constraints of the terms in a 
	vocabulary and expresses relationships among terms in the vocabulary using some 
	kind of ontology representation language. The transition from simple vocabulary 
	to complex ontology is a continuum without a distinct boundary. At one extreme 
	are vocabularies such as Darwin Core where, although defined in RDF, properties 
	have few or no expressed relationships to other properties or classes, and 
	there are no defined relationships among the classes.

DIFFERENCE BETWEEN SKOS RDFS AND OWL

	http://answers.semanticweb.com/questions/11560/what-is-the-differnce-between-skos-rdfs-and-owl

	So, first you have RDF which uses XML syntax to implement a semantic to 
	describe resources. But it has limited vocabulary.

	Then, you have RDFS, which is built on top of RDF with some stronger semantics 
	such as Class,SubClass,Domain,Range

	Now, you have SKOS and OWL which have different semantics and are intended for 
	different application. OWL provides a language for knowledge representation and 
	has semantically strict relationship such as Super/Subclass relationship.

	SKOS is used mainly for knowledge Organization and has weaker semantic 
	relationship such as Narrower/Broader,related and lexical relationship for 
	prefLabel(prefered label),altLabel(alternative Label). OWL is very expressive 
	and such expressiveness is not desired in some application because 
	expressiveness do has a cost. So, SKOS has limited expressivity compared to 
	OWL. It can be used for e.g. in Document Navigation System while OWL will be 
	used in areas where lots of inferences need to made to get new piece of 
	knowledge.

	The broader/Narrower in SKOS should not be confused with Super/Subclass in OWL. 
	In SKOS, if a concept A is linked by "broader" to concept B, it doesn't mean 
	than B is the superclass of A and we cannot make inference that all As are B.



	Thus a simple description of a term allows it to be adapted to uses that were 
	not conceived by the original creators of the term.

	5.3.2.1. Serving data from an existing relational database as RDF

	It is possible to implement an interface which allows a traditional relational 
	database to serve RDF metadata.

	The D2QR Platform (13) provides a mapping language that facilitates mapping and 
	translation. With this interface, the database can serve the data as Linked 
	Data and can also respond to SPARQL queries (see section 6.). D2QR also permits 
	dumping the entire database into a file as RDF in various forms. (14)

	Virtuoso (15) can transparently access native relational data as well as RDF 
	data stored in its database. It allows SPARQL queries.

	Triplify (16) is an application that can make content of small (less than 100MB 
	database content) web-accessible databases also available as RDF. It converts 
	the results of SQL queries into RDF.

	Triplifier (17) is being developed by the BiSciCol project 
	(http://biscicol.blogspot.com/) to input data from flat data formats 
	(spreadsheets, Darwin Core Archives) and relational databases, and output RDF 
	triples.

	ezDBDB (18) converts metadata from simple data sources like spreadsheets into 
	RDF and provides an opportunity to cache the resulting data in a triplestore 
	and make it available to the LOD cloud.

	Bio2RDF Description at http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jbi.2008.03.004 "documents 
	from public bioinformatics databases such as Kegg, PDB, MGI, HGNC and several 
	of NCBI’s databases can now be made available in RDF format through a unique 
	URL in the form of http://bio2rdf.org/namespace:id"

RELATIONSHIP RDFS AND DCMI ABSTRACT MODEL
	- Because the DCMI Abstract Model was developed based on the concepts defined 
	in RDF and RDFS, there is a direct relationship between the concepts discussed 
	in section 4.3. and those which are described formally in RDFS.

	DCAM			RDF/RDFS
	----------------------------
	resource		rdfs:Resource
	property or element	rdf:Property
	class			rdfs:Class
	syntax encoding scheme	rdfs:Datatype
	has domain		rdfs:domain
	has range		rdfs:range
	sub-property of	rdfs:subPropertyOf
	sub-class of	rdfs:subClassOf

RDFS
	RDFS extends the basic RDF syntax by defining additional terms which facilitate the 
	categorization of resources into classes, and which describe how properties are related 
	to those classes.

	eg. the 'a' or type thing.

	The RDFS schema is silent about what constitutes appropriate classes or types in a particular 
	situation. Users are free to use any pre-existing types/classes or to define their own. 

	However, since the purpose of having classes seems to be to allow 
	different users to know that they are both talking about the same kind of 
	resource, it is a best practice to use well-known types rather than making up 
	ad hoc types.(25) The wiki page ClassInventory lists classes defined in some 
	well-known vocabularies and ontologies. 


DCAM
	Dublin Core Abstract Model
		4.3.2.7. Sub-classes and sub-properties
	

	
		- The DCMI Abstract Model allows a class to be related to another class by a 
		sub-class relationship. One class is a sub-class of another class if all 
		instances of the first class are also instances of the second class. For 
		example dcterms:FileFormat is defined to be a sub-class of dcterms:MediaType. 
		Therefore, anything which is a dcterms:FileFormat is also a dcterms:MediaType.

		- The DCAM also allows a property to be related to another property by a 
		sub-property relationship. A property is a sub-property of another property if 
		all instances of the first property also have the same relationship as the 
		second property. For example dcterms:creator is a sub-property of 
		dcterms:contributor.

ONTOLOGY
	- "Although there is no strict definition of an ontology, it is generally 
	recognized that an ontology describes the formal constraints of the terms in a 
	vocabulary and 
	- expresses relationships among terms in the vocabulary using some 
	kind of ontology representation language."

	- systems have been developed to extend basic RDF and provide ways to 
	indicate more clearly the nature of resources and the relationships between 
	them. RDFS (section 4.4.) and OWL (section 7.4.) provide increasingly complex 
	means of describing such relationships.

	- Terms that are described as part of an ontology carry much more meaning and can be used 
	to do more sophisticated machine reasoning (i.e. to "generate" new triples from existing ones).


SKOS
	SKOS is just a stand-alone vocabulary, built with OWL and RFS, like many others 
	like FOAF, SIOC, GoodRelations... Its specific purpose is to model Thesaurii in RDF 


SKOS-XL 
	extends this SKOS labelling features by giving a Class to the Label object


RDF:TYPE
	In section 3.2.3. it was noted that the predicate rdf:type has the 
	special role in RDF of indicating class membership. As a shortcut method in 
	RDF/XML, the XML container element for the object being described can be named 
	as the class of which the described resource is an instance rather than using 
	the generic rdf:Description container name. When this is done, there is an 
	implied rdf:type statement that is not shown in the actual XML but which exists 
	and will be listed in any set of triples or shown in any graphical 
	representation. So the two XML snippets:

	<foaf:Person 
	rdf:about="http://bioimages.vanderbilt.edu/contact/kirchoff#coblea">
	  <foaf:name>Ashley Coble</foaf:name>
	</foaf:Person>

	and

	<rdf:Description rdf:about="http://bioimages.vanderbilt.edu/contact/kirchoff#coblea">
	  <rdf:type rdf:resource="http://xmlns.com/foaf/0.1/Person"/>
	  <foaf:name>Ashley Coble</foaf:name>
	</rdf:Description>

	say exactly the same thing. 
	---------

	- In N3, the subject is listed, followed by an indented list 
	predicate/object pairs. The special role of the rdf:type property is recognized 
	here by using "a" in place of the rdf:type predicate, i.e. saying that 
	agents:kirchoff#coblea is "a foaf:Person". 

Ontology expressed in OWL (whose statements are themselves expressed in RDF) 

SPO
	OBJECT
		subject - predicate - object
		eg.
		shakespeare - author - plays

		subject is a URI and unambigious.

	PREDICATE
		- also called the 'property'

		- "Like the subject, the predicate is also described by a URI."

		- "The predicate is generally a term from a well-known vocabulary or ontology"

	OBJECT
		- The object represents something that is related to the subject through 
		the relationship described by the predicate. 

		- "The object can be of two types: literals (character strings) and URIs."

		- "predicates whose objects are literals probably tend to be simple properties of the object, while" 

		- "predicates whose objects are URIs are more likely to express 
		relationships between the object and some other resource that is itself likely 
		to be the object of additional RDF descriptions." 

		- Web Ontology Language (OWL) provides a means to declare whether a predicate 
		is a literal or a URI reference (see section 7.6.3. for more on this)." 

		- When the Object is a uri rather than a literal, we have a (multi)graph.


	OTHER
		- The subjects and objects are referred to as nodes. 
		- The predicates are referred to as arcs.


NAMEPACING.
		- note that actually makes things look like literals.

		kimage: is an abbreviation for "http://bioimages.vanderbilt.edu/kirchoff/"

LINKED DATA AND RDF

	"Linked Data is the use of RDF:SeeAlso and OWL:SameAs relationships (amongst others) to publish data and interlink the instances between different data sets."


OWL and SKOS

	What is the relationship between OWL:SameAs versus using SKOS:match, SKOS:exactMatch etc. 

	Personally I think 
		link:uri (One of possibly many URIs which identify something.) covers many use cases; 
		rdfs:seeAlso covers another large proportion, and finally 
		owl:sameAs is useful when you want the strong semantics - can't find a use case which isn't covered by these three.

	- "Linked Data is the use of RDF:SeeAlso and OWL:SameAs relationships (amongst others) to publish data and interlink the instances between different data sets."

	- "The RDF Schema class and property system is similar to the type systems of object-oriented programming languages such as Java."
	----
	SKOS is OWL. 

	"As seen above, SOKS is an RDF/OWL vocabulary which can be seamlessly extended.."

SKOS Core - thesaurus.

SKOS Core[21] defines the classes and properties sufficient to represent the 
common features found in a standard thesaurus. It is based on a concept-centric 
view of the vocabulary, where primitive objects are not terms, but abstract 
notions represented by terms. Each SKOS concept is defined as an RDF resource. 
Each concept can have RDF properties attached, including:

    - one or more preferred index terms (at most one in each natural language)
    - alternative terms or synonyms
    - definitions and notes, with specification of their language

Concepts can be organized in hierarchies using broader-narrower relationships, 
or linked by non-hierarchical (associative) relationships. Concepts can be 
gathered in concept schemes, to provide consistent and structured sets of 
concepts, representing whole or part of a controlled vocabulary.

These features represent the stable part of SKOS Core. Other elements of the 
vocabulary are still considered unstable.[citation needed]

	 Kim - 

	The wording of the brief in trying to summarise the task in one sentence to 
	begin with is probably a little misleading. We already know (I think) that 
	
	SISSVoc out of the box has *not* been designed as an authoring and vocab 
	management tool, but rather a publishing and retrieval tool, so before 
	commencing an evaluation on that product we know most of the evaluation will 
	end up focussing on the ‘publishing and retrieval' aspects.

LDP

	LDP by contrast looks like it has authoring and management capability in addition 
	to publishing capability. Anyway, I think you are correct. The evaluation should be 
	covering term authoring and management which was alluded to in the expansion on the 
	‘purpose’ in part (a) of Roger’s brief by including 'maintaining and 
	populating' the different platforms. But it wasn't clear enough.

REIFICATION
	- The body of knowledge modeled by a collection of statements may be subjected to 
	reification, in which each statement (that is each triple 
	subject-predicate-object altogether) is assigned a URI and treated as a 
	resource about which additional statements can be made, as in "Jane says that 
	John is the author of document X". Reification is sometimes important in order 
	to deduce a level of confidence or degree of usefulness for each statement.

	- In a reified RDF database, each original statement, being a resource, itself, 
	most likely has at least three additional statements made about it: one to 
	assert that its subject is some resource, one to assert that its predicate is 
	some resource, and one to assert that its object is some resource or literal. 
	More statements about the original statement may also exist, depending on the 
	application's needs.

TRIPLE STORE DATABASE

	- A triplestore is a purpose-built database for the storage and retrieval of 
	triples,[1] a triple being a data entity composed of subject-predicate-object, 
	like "Bob is 35" or "Bob knows Fred".

	Much like a relational database, one stores information in a triplestore and 
	retrieves it via a query language. Unlike a relational database, a triplestore 
	is optimized for the storage and retrieval of triples. In addition to queries, 
	triples can usually be imported/exported using Resource Description Framework 
	(RDF) and other formats.

SWISH
	Interesting
	Swish is a framework, written in the purely functional programming language 
	Haskell, for performing deductions in RDF data using a variety of techniques.

SKOS 
	- Simple Knowledge Organization System (SKOS) is a W3C recommendation 
	designed for representation of thesauri, classification schemes, taxonomies, 
	subject-heading systems, 
		or any other type of structured controlled vocabulary.
		- SKOS is part of the Semantic Web family of standards built upon RDF 
	and RDFS, and its main objective is to enable easy publication and use of such 
	vocabularies as linked data.
		- This mechanism for describing resources is a major component in the 
	W3C's Semantic Web activity:


RDFS = RDF schema


SPARQL.

	Simple Protocol and RDF Query Language

RDF
	- core concept - is tripple =  subject, predicate, object

	- Includes Dublin core.

	- The resource "http://www.w3.org/People/EM/contact#me" is the subject.
	The objects are:
		"Eric Miller" (with a predicate "whose name is"),
		mailto:e.miller123(at)example (with a predicate "whose email address is"), and
		"Dr." (with a predicate "whose title is").


		- The Resource Description Framework (RDF) is a family of World Wide 
	Web Consortium (W3C) specifications [1] originally designed as a metadata data 
	model. It has come to be used as a general method for conceptual description or 
	modeling of information that is implemented in web resources, using a variety 
	of syntax notations and data serialization formats.

		subject / predicate
		based upon the idea of making statements about resources (in particular 
	web resources) in the form of subject-predicate-object expressions.

		 These expressions are known as triples in RDF terminology. The subject 
	denotes the resource, and the predicate denotes traits or aspects of the 
	resource and expresses a relationship between the subject and the object. For 
	example, one way to represent the notion "The sky has the color blue" in RDF is 
	as the triple: a subject denoting "the sky", a predicate denoting "has", and an 
	object denoting "the color blue". 

	A collection of RDF statements intrinsically represents a labeled, directed 
	multi-graph. As such, an RDF-based data model is more naturally suited to 
	certain kinds of knowledge representation than the relational model and other 
	ontological models.  
	--

	- The root RDF data model is deliberately very minimal and, as with 
	XML, that minimalism is intended to make things easier for programs. 

	- One consequence of that minimalism, when coupled with other 
	machine-friendly design tropes, is that though "human readable", RDF is not 
	generally very human writable (although the Notation3 syntax tries to improve 
	things.) 

	- Furthermore, while RDF's data model is specified, the processing 
	model isn't (deliberately), so one should expect a wide variety of processors, 
	each working in its own way, depending on a variety of constraints and 
	desiderata.

CONTOLLED VOCABULARY
	- 
	Controlled vocabularies provide a way to organize knowledge for 
	subsequent retrieval. They are used in subject indexing schemes, subject 
	headings, thesauri, etc 

	Controlled vocabulary schemes mandate predefined, authorised terms 
	preselected by the designer of the vocabulary, in contrast to natural language 
	vocabularies without restriction.

RDF query language  / SPARQL
	- specifically a query language for databases, able to retrieve and 
	manipulate data stored in Resource Description Framework format.
	- SPARQL is emerging as the de facto RDF query language

	SPARQL allows for a query to consist of triple patterns, conjunctions, 
	disjunctions, and optional patterns.[7]
