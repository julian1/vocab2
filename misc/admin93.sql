-- Usage psql -f create_class_view.sql

-- shows postgres objects(classes) relations, sequences, indexes etc and their owners and permissions
-- psql -c "alter default privileges for role postgres in schema public revoke all on tables from  aaa"

-- we just need to use the array function to exapand the default attributes stored as an array. - then we can write
-- a function to pull off all the default attributes from a schema.
